# Simple To-Do Application with Vue.js

## This simple Todo app done with Vue.js lets you add or remove a Todo item to your list.

## It is done with Vue.js and Skeleton CSS because they are very lightweight

# Future Development

## For future development I would create a Mongo Database to save the Todos and maybe start creating a Trello-like system.
